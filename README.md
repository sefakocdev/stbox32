## 🔧 Hardware Architecture

### Core Components
- **Microcontroller:** STM32F411RET6 (ARM Cortex-M4, 100MHz)
- **Display:** 2.8" TFT LCD (240x320 pixels) with ST7789V controller
- **Input:** Two analog joysticks (X/Y axes + push buttons)
- **Audio:** Piezo buzzer for sound effects
- **Power:** Battery pack with power switch
- **Enclosure:** Custom 3D-printed case

### Communication Interfaces
- **SPI:** LCD display communication
- **ADC:** Joystick analog input reading
- **GPIO:** Button inputs and control signals
- **PWM:** Buzzer control for sound generation

## 🏗️ Software Architecture

### Core System
- **Real-time Control:** HAL-based peripheral management
- **Graphics Engine:** Custom SPI-optimized drawing routines
- **Input System:** Analog joystick processing with direction mapping
- **Sound System:** PWM-based tone generation
- **Menu System:** Interactive game selection interface

### Performance Optimizations
Due to SPI interface limitations and lack of internal framebuffer:
- **Selective Redrawing:** Only modified screen regions are updated
- **Minimized Fill Operations:** Large filled areas are avoided for better performance
- **Efficient Drawing Routines:** Custom functions minimize SPI transactions
- **Real-time Optimization:** Graphics rendering optimized for smooth gameplay

### Prerequisites
- **STM32CubeIDE** or compatible ARM GCC toolchain
- **STM32F411RE** development board (NUCLEO-F411RE recommended)
- **Hardware components** as listed in the hardware section

### Hardware Setup
1. Connect the 2.8" TFT LCD to SPI1 (pins specified in `main.h`)
2. Wire analog joysticks to ADC channels (PA0, PA1, PA4, PB0)
3. Connect buzzer to PWM-capable pin (TIM3_CH2)
4. Add push buttons and power switch as specified
5. Assemble in 3D-printed enclosure

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Power On:** Use the power switch to turn on the device
2. **Main Menu:** Navigate through games using the joystick
3. **Game Selection:** Press joystick button to select a game
4. **Gameplay:** Use dual joysticks for game control
5. **Sound Toggle:** Option available in menu to enable/disable sound
6. **Reset:** Use hardware reset button to restart system and returns to main menu

## 🎮 Games Description

### Breakout
Classic brick-breaking game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy bricks. Features multiple levels with increasing difficulty.

### Pong
Two-player table tennis simulation. Each player controls a paddle to hit the ball back and forth. First to reach the score limit wins.

### 1942
Top-down scrolling shooter where players control an aircraft, avoiding enemies and obstacles while shooting targets.

### Snake
The classic snake game where players guide a growing snake to eat food while avoiding walls and the snake's own body.

### Tetris
Block-stacking puzzle game where players arrange falling tetromino pieces to complete horizontal lines.

### Car Race
Racing game where players navigate a car through obstacles and other vehicles on a scrolling track.

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Graphics Limitations
- **SPI Speed Constraint:** Display updates are limited by SPI interface speed
- **No Framebuffer:** Each pixel must be sent directly to display
- **DMA Challenges:** ST7789V command structure makes DMA implementation complex

### Optimization Strategies
- **Selective Updates:** Only changed screen regions are redrawn
- **Efficient Primitives:** Custom drawing functions minimize SPI overhead
- **Smart Rendering:** Avoid large filled areas, prefer smaller objects

### Future Improvements
- DMA implementation for faster graphics
- Additional games and features
- Enhanced sound system with multiple channels
- Wireless connectivity options
- Save game functionality
